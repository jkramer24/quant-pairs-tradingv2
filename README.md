Introduction

This project evaluates two pairs trading strategies within the Cryptocurrency market and combines them into a single portfolio. The strategies use historical price data to generate trading signals based on coin relationships and residual spreads.

Data Collection and Preprocessing 

The data was collected from Yahoo Finance and contains daily closing prices for ADA, XLM, and 25 other major cryptocurrencies. I computed logarithmic returns for each coin to prepare the data for statistical analysis. For the multi-coin strategy, I created dynamic baskets of all available coins excluding the target coin to serve as a synthetic benchmark for regression-based pairs trading.

Optimization 

Optimization in this project was based on rolling linear regressions to calculate dynamic alpha and beta coefficients for each pair or basket strategy. Trading signals were generated using z-scores of the residual spreads, and entry and exit thresholds were selected to maximize the Sharpe Ratio.

Strategy I: ADA vs XLM

Signal Construction

Trading signals were generated by calculating the Z-score of the spread between ADA and XLM. Positions were taken long when the spread was below the negative entry threshold and short when the spread exceeded the positive entry threshold. Positions were exited when the spread reverted toward the mean, with entry and exit thresholds of 4.0 and 3.0 respectively. Transaction costs were included in all return calculations.

Performance

The ADA-XLM pairs trading strategy achieved a Sharpe ratio of 0.7829, demonstrating solid risk-adjusted returns. The strategy effectively captured mean-reversion opportunities between the two coins, with Z-score based signals ensuring timely entries and exits.



Strategy II:  Multi-Coin vs Basket

Signal Construction

For each coin in the top 25 cryptocurrencies, a rolling linear regression was run against a basket of the remaining coins. The residual spread was converted to a Z-score to generate trading signals. Signals were long when the Z-score was below the negative entry threshold and short when above the positive entry threshold. The strategy was rebalanced quarterly, and transaction costs were applied.

Performance

The multi-coin basket strategy achieved a Sharpe ratio of 0.5267, indicating consistent performance across the broader set of coins. By applying the regression and Z-score methodology across multiple coins, the strategy captured diversified mean-reversion opportunities and mitigated single-coin risk.


Strategy III: Combined Portfolio

Signal Construction

The combined portfolio merges the ADA–XLM pair strategy with the multi-coin versus basket strategy. Returns from both strategies were aligned on overlapping dates and equally weighted to form a single portfolio series. This preserves each strategy’s rolling regression and Z-score signal framework while leveraging diversification across coin pairs and baskets

Performance

The equal-weighted portfolio achieved a validation Sharpe ratio of 1.0225. By integrating the pair and basket strategies, the portfolio captures both targeted pair-based and broader market mean-reversion opportunities, enhancing risk-adjusted performance and providing more stable cumulative returns across training and validation periods.


Statistical Significance 

To evaluate whether the combined portfolio’s returns are merely tracking the broader crypto market, an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression was run with the portfolio returns as the dependent variable and the average returns of the top 25 cryptocurrencies (including BTC) as the independent variable.

The regression results indicate near-zero market sensitivity:

Alpha: 3.08×10⁻⁵
Beta: -0.0001
T-Statistics: Alpha 0.845, Beta -0.160
R-Squared: 0.000

The regression results indicate virtually no market sensitivity. Beta = -0.0001 with a t-statistic of -0.160, showing an essentially nonexistent relationship to broader market movements. Alpha = 3.08×10⁻⁵ with a t-statistic of 0.845, indicating statistically insignificant non-market returns. An R-squared of 0.000 demonstrates that none of the portfolio’s returns are explained by the market. These results confirm that the strategy is largely independent from overall crypto market movements, supporting its characterization as a market-neutral trading approach



Conclusion

This project examined crypto pairs trading strategies to capture mean-reverting relationships between correlated coins. Combining the ADA–XLM pair with a multi-coin basket produced a portfolio Sharpe ratio of 1.0225, showing improved risk-adjusted performance over BTC-based strategies. Regression analysis confirmed near-zero beta and statistically insignificant alpha, indicating the portfolio operates largely independently of the broader crypto market. These results highlight the importance of careful pair selection, structured signals, and diversification for building a consistent, market-neutral trading approach.
